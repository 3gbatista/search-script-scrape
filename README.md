## Search-Script-Scrape 

#### 101 webscraping and research tasks for the data journalist

This repository contains [101 Web data-collection tasks](#the-tasks) in Python 3 that I assigned to my [Computational Journalism class in Spring 2015](http://www.compjour.org) to give them regular exercise in programming and conducting research, and to expose them to the variety of data published online.

The hard part of many of these tasks is researching and finding the actual data source. Completing the task only requires writing a self-contained, just-get-the-data-and-print-the-answer script. 

Some examples of the tasks:

- [The California city whose city manager earns the most total wage per capita in 2012](https://github.com/compjour/search-script-scrape/blob/master/scripts/100.py)
- [In the most recently transcribed Supreme Court argument, the number of times laughter broke out](https://github.com/compjour/search-script-scrape/blob/master/scripts/50.py)
- [Number of days until Texas's next scheduled execution](scripts/29.py)
- [The U.S. congressmember with the most Twitter followers](https://github.com/compjour/search-script-scrape/blob/master/scripts/90.py)
- [The number of people who visited a U.S. government website using Internet Explorer 6.0 in the last 90 days](https://github.com/compjour/search-script-scrape/blob/master/scripts/3.py)

## Repo status


The table below links to the available scripts. If there's not a link, it means I haven't committed the code. Some of them I had to rethink a less verbose solution (or the target changed, as the Internet sometimes does), and now this repo has taken a backseat to many other data projects on my list. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` 

Note: A lot of the code is not best practice. The tasks are a little repetitive so I got bored and [ignored PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and/or tried new libraries/conventions for fun.


__Note:__ The second column of this table refers to __line count__ of the script, __not__ the answer to the prompt.

## How to run this stuff

Each task is meant to be a self-contained script: you run it, and it prints the answer I'm looking for. The [scripts](/scripts) in this repo should "just work"...if you have all the dependencies installed that I had while writing them, and the web URLs they target haven't changed...so, basically, these may not work at all.

To copy the scripts quickly via the command-line; by default, a ./search-script-scrape directory will be created:

    $ git clone https://github.com/compjour/search-script-scrape.git

To run a script:

    $ cd search-script-scrape
    $ python3 scripts/1.py

I leave it to you and Google to figure out how to run Python 3 on your own system. FWIW, I was using the [Python 3.4.3 provided by the Anaconda 2.2.0 installer for OS X](http://continuum.io/downloads#py34). The most common third-party libraries used are [Requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/) for downloading the files and [lxml for HTML parsing](http://lxml.de/).

## Post-mortem

The original requirement was that students finish all 100 scripts by the end of the quarter. That didn't quite work out so I reduced the requirement to 50. It was a bad idea to make this a "oh, just turn it in at the end of the year", as most people have the tendency to wait for finals week to do such work.

Most of the tasks are pretty straightforward, in terms of the Python programming. The majority of the time is figuring out exactly what the hell I'm referring to, so next time I do this, I'll probably provide the URL of the target page rather than having people attempt to divine the Google Path I used to get to the data.
